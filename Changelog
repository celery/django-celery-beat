.. _version-1.1.1:

1.1.1
=====
:release-date: 2018-2-18 2:30 p.m. UTC+3:00
:release-by: Omer Katz

- Fix interval schedules by providing nowfun.
- Removing code that forced last_run_at to be timezone naive for no reason, made timezone aware. Fixes crontab schedules after celery/celery#4173.
- Entry.last_run_at is no-longer timezone naive.
- Use a localized PyTZ timezone object for now() otherwise conversions fail scheduling breaks resulting in constant running of tasks or possibly not running ever.
- Fix endless migrations creation for solar schedules events.
- Prevent MySQL has gone away errors.
- Added support for Django 2.0.
- Adjust CrontabSchedule's minutes, hour & day_of_month fields max length
